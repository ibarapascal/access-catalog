# Summary of frontend dev (Draft)

Engineering & Standardization.  

## Concepts

For example React.

Status:  

1. multiple frameworks, huge amount of libs/tools.  
2. flexible coding style.  
3. various implement methods/approach.  
4. frequent misunderstanding of demands.  

Problem:  

1. catch-up costs. =>  
2. lower maintainability. =>  
3. lower efficency. =>  
4. lower quality.  

Target:  

1. reduce randomness. => R => Precision  
2. always keep close with best practice. => B => Accuracy  
3. be quick. => Q => Velocity  

Core requirement:  

1. process-flow.  
2. tools.  
3. templates.  
4. guidelines.  

### How to solve: standardization  

STD about work-flow:  

1. Design => layout Figma => Frontend <= data-flow visualization <= BFF.  
2. JIRA / Issue / QA team task management.  
3. Distinguish task/demand content and connections.  

STD about the selection of tools/libs:  

1. check: description, documentation, demo, download(trends), maintainability, scalability.  
2. demo: online tools: codesandbox. => demand implementation checklist.  

STD for developing process:  

1. CRA => CLI => customized CLI.  
2. Repo templates: PR/Issue, Contributing, Env settings.  
3. Tools-set: chrome extensions, vscode extensions, scripts.  
4. Code templates: redux, hooks best practices.  
5. CI related tools: format, documentation.  

STD for code format:  

1. Typescript.  
2. ESLint, Prettier, TSI settings for team.  
3. JSX, CSS in js, UI-libs style solution guidelines.  
4. directory structure, namespace guidelines.  
5. Usage of immutable, lodash, ramda.  

STD for documentation:  

1. data-flow in frontend.  
2. visualization: dependencies, import, commit history.  
3. static pages for components, doc-gen.  

STD for maintain:  

1. task pool, triggers => issue, github projects.  
2. dependencies bot.  
3. e2e test libs.  
4. CD with codepipeline + customized userscript.  

STD for solution finding (result as templates):  

1. Reproduce.  
2. Condition record.  
3. Notice points.  
4. Suggested solution.  
5. Process handling.  
6. Documentation.  
7. Review.  

### Others

1. sharing meeting.  
2. pair coding.  
3. active review discussion.  
4. keep tight with PO.
