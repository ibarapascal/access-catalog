not only yourself, but how to let the team outputs as well

- let the teammates all become the project owner  
  - communicate directly with the product & designer  
    - find what's really needed  
    - find what's the best approach for the product  
    - cut the bridge people  
  - responsible for the product itself  
    - to care about  
      - usability  
      - accessibility  
      - key value of the requirements  
    - to prevent to cut too much requirements based on development limitation by  
      - do it later  
      - do it in another way  
    - develop it then maintain it, notice the need of  
      - maintainable code  
      - docs  
      - tests  
- deliver all the features without blockers during the process  
  - cut the unnecessary environments & meetings  
    - learn from the open-source repos contributing methods  
    - use scrum & backlog well  
    - standup meeting need to be really standup (within 10mins)  
  - reduce the by-name dependencies from product to code  
    - define the work-flow for all the cases  
      - new services  
      - small adjustments  
      - hot-fix  
      - continuous improvements(kaizen)

  - provide reliable CI/CDs  
    - CI/CD works for the project, the requirements not for themself  
    - should not block any process or need multiple approvals  
- business should work, team should grow  
  - gain more resource & things to do for the team  
    - let them write the main code -> become the owner  
    - request more from top side  
  - top-down meeting should send the company value  
    - why should people trust the project they have done really works  
    - if won't work, let them know ASAP  
  - team share
    - what they are doing now -> daily standup  
    - the tech problems / solutions -> team share / docs platform  
    - recent tech directions-> news channel  
    - code review -> not only peer PR review
