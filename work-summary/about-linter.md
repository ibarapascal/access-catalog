### What's linter

### The approach I made

Eslint & Prettier & Stylelint Best practice (2021-CTW)  

npm packages  

- eslint-config-react  
- prettier-config-recommended  
- stylelint-config-recommended  

later on with TailwindCSS

### The most concern points to answer

TODO

- Is it easy to use/set in other new repos  
- Is it easy to join existing projects  
- Do we need to define it really specific / the usage situation cross different projects  
- The maintenance  
- Work with IDE
