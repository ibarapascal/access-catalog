## This is an unfinished docs!

The related content is also mentioned in React new document in Beta (check the content [here](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks)).

There could be a new API to handle it as well, so I'm just gonna summarize this part later on.
